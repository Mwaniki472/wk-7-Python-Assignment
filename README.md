# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore a dataset using **pandas**.
- Perform basic data analysis (descriptive statistics, grouping).
- Visualize results with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.

The **Iris dataset** is used in this project, loaded either from:
- `scikit-learn` (`load_iris`) **OR**
- CSV from Seabornâ€™s GitHub repository.


# ðŸ“Š Tasks Completed

## ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Load & Explore
- Loaded dataset (Iris).
- Displayed first rows with `.head()`.
- Checked structure with `.info()`.
- Verified missing values with `.isnull().sum()`.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Basic Analysis
- Computed descriptive statistics using `.describe()`.
- Grouped by species and calculated mean values.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Visualizations
- **Line Chart** â€“ Sepal length trend across samples.
- **Bar Chart** â€“ Average petal length per species.
- **Histogram** â€“ Distribution of sepal width.
- **Scatter Plot** â€“ Relationship between sepal length and petal length, color-coded by species.
